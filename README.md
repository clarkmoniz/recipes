This project is a basic recipe website using HTML and CSS.

The purpose of this project is to revisit the basics of HTMl and CSS.

It consists of a main index page which has links to a few recipes. The website displays the bare minimum with its markup and styling.

Future updates with styling and added functionality might be added later in the future, but for now it is a basic recipe website.
